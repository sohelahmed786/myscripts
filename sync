#### **Finding #3: Missing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Header**

- **Vulnerability Name:**  
  HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Header Missing

- **Severity:**  
  Medium

- **Threat Type:**  
  Security Misconfiguration / Transport Layer Protection

- **Description:**  
  The application does not set the `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP response header. HSTS is a security feature that instructs browsers to only interact with the site over HTTPS, protecting users from certain types of attacks, such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking via man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Impact:**  
  Without HSTS, users may unintentionally access the application over insecure HTTP, exposing them to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could intercept or manipulate traffic. The absence of this header weakens the browser’s ability to enforce secure connections, putting user credentials and session data at risk.

- **Proposed Remediation:**  
  Configure the web server to include the `Strict-Transport-Security` header in all HTTPS responses (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`). Test thoroughly to ensure all resources are accessible via HTTPS before enabling HSTS, and consider submitting your site to the browser preload list for added protection.
