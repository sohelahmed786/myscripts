#### **Finding #5: Email Address Disclosure in HTTP Response**

- **Vulnerability Name:**  
  Disclosure of Sensitive Information – Email Address in Response

- **Severity:**  
  Low

- **Threat Type:**  
  Information Disclosure

- **Description:**  
  The application returns user email addresses in its HTTP responses, either within the response body, headers, or error messages. This information may be visible to anyone with access to the response, including unauthorized users or attackers probing the application.

- **Impact:**  
  Disclosing email addresses increases the risk of targeted phishing, spam, social engineering attacks, and user enumeration. Attackers can collect these email addresses to launch further attacks against users or compromise their accounts on this or other platforms.

- **Proposed Remediation:**  
  Review and update the application logic to avoid including sensitive user details, such as email addresses, in HTTP responses unless strictly necessary and explicitly authorized. Return only the minimum required information to users and implement access controls to restrict sensitive data exposure. Consider data masking or anonymization for responses when appropriate.
