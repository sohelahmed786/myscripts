#### **Finding #8: Clickjacking Vulnerability (Internal Network)**

- **Vulnerability Name:**  
  Missing Clickjacking Protection (X-Frame-Options / CSP)

- **Severity:**  
  Medium  
  *(On internal systems, typically Medium severity unless the application handles highly sensitive data, in which case it may be higher.)*

- **Threat Type:**  
  UI Redressing / Clickjacking

- **Description:**  
  The web application does not implement the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header or Content Security Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive. This omission allows the application to be embedded within an iframe on another site, making it vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. An attacker on the internal network could trick users into performing undesired actions by overlaying the application within a hidden frame.

- **Impact:**  
  A successful clickjacking attack could allow a malicious internal user to manipulate staff into unintentionally authorizing transactions, changing settings, or disclosing sensitive information, depending on the application's functionality. Even in internal environments, this can undermine data integrity and trust.

- **Proposed Remediation:**  
  Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`, or implement a suitable CSP with the `frame-ancestors` directive to restrict which sites can embed the application in a frame. Regularly review these settings to ensure ongoing protection against UI redressing threats.
