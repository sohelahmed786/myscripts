  Outdated Select2 Version – CVE-2016-10744

- **Severity:**  
  High

- **Threat Type:**  
  Vulnerable Third-Party Component / Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Description:**  
  The application includes Select2 JavaScript library version 4.0.3, which is affected by a known vulnerability (CVE-2016-10744). This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML via specific user-controlled input, which can be executed in the context of another user's browser session.

- **Impact:**  
  Exploitation of this vulnerability could enable an attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. Sensitive user data and application integrity may be at risk if the vulnerable component is left unpatched.

- **Proposed Remediation:**  
  Upgrade the Select2 library to the latest secure version (at least 4.0.5 or later) where this issue is resolved. Review the application for other outdated JavaScript dependencies and ensure all third-party components are maintained at current, supported versions. Regularly monitor sources such as the NVD or vendor advisories for security updates.
